# Design-Thinking-YP

Originally created by @nogainbar and @bradreeder for a 2-day design sprint with the Anna Freud Centre on the subject of stigma around mental health. 24 young people (aged 12-14) participated.

The workshop contained in this repo is a format for running a two-day design workshop with young people. It takes them through the five stages of [design thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) (empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test) culminating in a testable prototype that attempts to solve a user-centric problem identified throughout the workshop.
